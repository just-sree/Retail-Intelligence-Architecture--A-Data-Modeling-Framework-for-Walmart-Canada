# Retail Intelligence Architecture: A Data Modeling Framework for Walmart Canada
 This project presents a comprehensive dimensional data modeling framework designed to support analytics and strategic decision-making across Walmart Canada's retail operations. It integrates five critical business domains — Sales & Revenue Optimization, Inventory Management, eCommerce, Real Estate Development, and Employee Benefits Management — into a unified, normalized data warehouse architecture.  The deliverables include fact and dimension tables for each domain, realistic synthetic datasets, and an integrated data model that enables storytelling, cross-functional insights, and scalable business intelligence solutions.
